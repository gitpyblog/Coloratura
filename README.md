# 🦜Coloratura

##### Awsome **cprint()** function to colored terminal text. Supported full RGB!

---



### Installation

You can install `hue` with **pip** as follows:

```
pip install coloratura
```

### Usage

First of all, get the basic cprint functions and selected color palettes:

```python
from coloratura import cprint, Pantone, Bit4
```

Printing colored text is incredibly easy:

```python
cprint('This text is in the CLASSIC BLUE color from the Pantone palette', color=Pantone.CLASSIC_BLUE)
```

**Easy right?**
But what if you want to print text with a colored background?

```python
cprint('This is great!', color=Pantone.EMERALD, bg=Pantone.ULTIMATE_GRAY)```
```

You can also add decorations to the font:

```python
cprint('This string is italic and green', color=Bit4.GREEN, styles=['italic'])
```

You can mix multiple text decorations

```python
cprint('This string is italic and bold', , styles=['italic', 'bold'])
```

### Colors and styles

#### List of all styles

> bold, italic, underline, strong-underline, crossed-out, framed

**Remember:** Styles can be mixed together by including them in the list of strings

#### List of all colors from the pantone palette

> ILLUMINATING, ULTIMATE_GRAY, CLASSIC_BLUE, LIVING_CORAL, ULTRA_VIOLET, GREENERY, ROSE_QUARTZ, SERENITY, MARSALA, RADIANT_ORCHID, EMERALD, TANGERINE_TANGO, HONEYSUCKLE, TURQUOISE

#### List of all colors from the 4bit palette

> BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, BRIGHT_BLACK, BRIGHT_RED, BRIGHT_GREEN, BRIGHT_YELLOW, BRIGHT_BLUE, BRIGHT_MAGENTA, BRIGHT_CYAN, BRIGHT_WHITE

**Too little? 🤔**
With the Color class you can define your own colors in the full RGB spectrum 😍

Look how simple it is:

```python
YOUR_COLOR = Color('rgb', 191, 25, 50)
```

**Note:** Windows versions below windows 10 do not support ANSI escape sequences so the colors will not be printed in command prompt.

### *..and this is just the beginning of this great library!* 💚
